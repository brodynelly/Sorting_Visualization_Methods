The timing stuff shows you
which ones are faster but
honestly some of the delays
might make things look weird
compared to what you'd expect
in real life. Quick sort and
shell sort were kinda tricky to
get the visualization right.

I bumped up the window size
to 1400x800 pixels and played
around with all the GridLayout
spacing. Had to reduce some of
the gaps between elements to
fit everything in properly but
also make sure there was enough
room for all 8 sorting
algorithms plus the reset
button.

TO RUN:
- Open it up in IntelliJ
  (should just work if you open
  the whole folder)
- Go into src then
  bsn3g9_cs4050_assignment1
- Right click on SortGUI.java
  and hit "Run SortGUI.main()"
- OR you can probably just hit
  the green play button once you
  open SortGUI.java

Main class is: bsn3g9_cs4050_as
signment1.SortGUI
